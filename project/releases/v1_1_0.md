# Remove proprietary dependencies
 
_2022-01-15 v1.1.0_

Dependencies on proprietary Datomic dev-local and pro systems are now removed from the distributed core `molecule` module. This allows using Molecule with Datomic free without having to download other free but proprietary Datomic dev-tools and pro database.

Tests in the non-distributed `moleculeTests` module still depend on dev-local and pro to ensure that all Datomic systems work with Molecule.

The sample projects in the [molecule-samples](https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule-samples) repo show how to use Molecule with any Datomic database system.
