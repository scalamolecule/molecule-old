Major over-haul of Molecule

## Thorough Scala docs API documentation

All relevant public interfaces have been documented in the new [Scala docs](http://www.scalamolecule.org/api/molecule). 
Shortcuts to Scala docs sub packages and documents are also directly available via "API docs" in the menu on 
the [Molecule website](http://www.scalamolecule.org).

To aid constructing molecules in your code, all attributes defined now also have Scala docs automatically defined by 
the [sbt-molecule plugin](https://github.com/scalamolecule) upon compilation.

 
## Input molecules correctly implemented 

Input molecules are now semantically correctly implemented and thoroughly tested 
([1 input](https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule/blob/master/coretests/src/test/scala/molecule/coretests/input1),
[2 inputs](https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule/blob/master/coretests/src/test/scala/molecule/coretests/input2),
[3 inputs](https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule/blob/master/coretests/src/test/scala/molecule/coretests/input3)).

## Interfaces updated and streamlined

The standard getters return Lists of tuples of type-casted tuples.

- `get`
- `getAsOf(t)`
- `getSince(t)`
- `getHistory`
- `getWith(txData)`

If large data sets are expected, an Iterable of tuples of lazily type-cased tuples can be retrieved instead. 
Data is type-casted on each call to `next` on the iterator.

- `getIterable`
- `getIterableAsOf(t)`
- `getIterableSince(t)`
- `getIterableHistory`
- `getIterableWith(txData)`

If typed data is not required we can get the raw untyped java collections of Lists of objects.

- `getRaw`
- `getRawAsOf(t)`
- `getRawSince(t)`
- `getRawHistory`
- `getRawWith(txData)`

### Breaking changes

The whole directory layout of the Molecule library has been re-arranged and optimized, including many interfaces. 
So you might have to change some method names if you have used earlier versions of Molecule.
