# Json output dropped
 
_2021-01-16 v0.24.0_

Json as output is dropped which means that methods `getJson` and `getAsyncJson` are no longer available on molecules.

The semantics were unclear and json can anyway easily be made with any desired semantics from Model and typed tuples instead. Json output also felt like a black sheep in the typed Molecule eco-system. Moving forward now with what Molecule does best: outputting typed and molecule-matching data.
