# Bug fixes
_2019-04-02 v0.18.3_

Bugfixes: 

- Card-many ref attributes now have the same api as other card-many attributes (Set's of values can now be applied to both types).
- Variable resolution on fulltext searches added.
- Text attributes can now handle text input with quotation marks.  
- Touching entity ids with `Entity` now correctly handles all types.


Improvement:

- For a more direct query evaluation, applying a single value to an attribute is now `ground`ed to a variable instead of using `comparison`.
