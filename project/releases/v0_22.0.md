# Automatic Query optimization
 
_2020-04-07 v0.22.0_

Molecule now transparently optimize all queries sent to Datomic. 

Most selective
Clauses are automatically grouped first in the :where section of the Datomic query as per
the recommendation in [Datomic Best Practices](https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/best-practices.html#most-selective-clauses-first). 

This brings dramatic performance gains of in some cases beyond 100x compared to 
un-optimized queries. The optimization happens automatically in the background 
so that you can focus entirely on your domain without concern for the optimal 
order of attributes in your molecules.


Bug fixes:

- Correct resolution of multiple attrs in refs in tx meta data
- Optimization of Index/Log operations
- Optional card-many attributes now return all values (not Datomic default max 1000)
- Correctly converting Iterables in raw queries
- Re-use attr variable in query when applying multiple aggregates to the same attr
- Fulltext search allowed on optional attributes
