# Sorting and pagination (offset & cursor). Schema history 
 
_2022-02-15 v1.2.0_



Since we can't pull optional data on a Datomic history database, molecule now retrieves and organize the optional data in the background at runtime to allow a consistent api for the user. This allows for tracking all changes over time of the schema of a database including filtering and sorting by the meta attributes of interest.
