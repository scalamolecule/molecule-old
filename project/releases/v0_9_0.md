Major upgrade of Molecule introducing _Bidirectional_ references. 

Normal Datomic references are unidirectional. If we add a friend reference from Ann to Ben

```scala
Person.name("Ann").Friends.name("Ben").save
```
Then we can naturally query to get friends of Ann

```scala
Person.name_("Ann").Friends.name.get === List("Ben")
```

But what if we want to find friends of Ben? This will give us nothing:

```scala
Person.name_("Ben").Friends.name.get === List()
```

Instead we would have to think backwards to get the back reference
 
```scala
 Person.name_.Friends.name("Ben").get === List("Ann")
```

If we want to traverse deeper into a friendship graph we would have to query both forward and backward for each
step in the graph which would quickly become a pain. Please see 
[Bidirectional refs]() for more information and the [Gremlin graph examples]().



- This release also adds support for BigInts and BigDecimals. Only bytes is not supported now due to the limited 
capabilities this type has in Datomic.
- Input molecules can now also include nested data structures.
