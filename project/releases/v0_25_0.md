# Molecule object output and dynamic molecules
 
_2021-03-04 v0.25.0_

Return each data row as an object with named properties. 

As an alternative to tuple output, object properties make it easy to map molecules to forms and other larger structures that benefit from being able to navigating many attributes/properties by name rather than tuple arity position (_1, _2 etc). Property names and types are inferred by the IDE even for references to related data that can nest up to 7 levels deep. 

```scala
val ben = Person.name_("Ben").age.gender.Address.street.City.name.getObj

ben.age === 23
ben.gender === "male"
ben.Address.street === "Broadway"
ben.Address.City.name === "New York"
```

### Dynamic molecules
An exotic new feature that could help domain modelling is the ability to add a code body to a molecule! A Molecule macro makes data of a single molecule result object available to a locally defined body of code. And Scala's Dynamic feature makes the code dynamically available from the outside.

```scala
val ben = Person.name("Ben").age.gender.Address.street.City.name.getObj { self =>
  def info = s"${self.name} (${self.age}) lives on ${self.Address.street}, ${self.Address.City.name}" 
}

// We can now both access data and call body code
ben.age === 23
ben.gender === "male"
ben.Address.street === "Broadway"
ben.Address.City.name === "New York"
ben.info === "Ben (23) lives on Broadway, New York"
```
(The `self` reference to the object can be named to what you prefer)

Dynamic molecules can be a way of not having to create a domain case class and populate it with data, but instead load the data with a molecule and then add functionality to it! This of course presumes that the functionality is only needed in some local context.
