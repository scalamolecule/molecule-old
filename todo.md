- `import scala.collection.Seq` can mess upp macro creation of a molecule - check out why.

- Sometimes when running the first test from the JS side after doing changes gives an "Error: read ECONNRESET". Just running the test again works as expected. Would be nice to avoid this. Only relates to library (molecule) code changes.
