# ‚òç Molecule

Molecule is a type safe and intuitive Scala query/modelling DSL for 
[Datomic][datomic] - the immutable database of facts.

# What Molecule does

As an example: to find

_Names of twitter/facebook_page communities in neighborhoods of southern districts_
 
we can compose a "molecule query" that is very close to our
human sentence:

```scala
Community.name.`type`("twitter" or "facebook_page")
  .Neighborhood.District.region("sw" or "s" or "se")
```

Molecule transforms this at compile time (with macros) to a little more elaborate Datalog query string and
 input rules that finds those communities in the Datomic database:

<pre>
[:find ?a
 :in $ %
 :where
   [?ent :community/name ?a]
   (rule1 ?ent)
   [?ent :community/neighborhood ?c]
   [?c :neighborhood/district ?d]
   (rule2 ?d)]

INPUTS:
List(
  datomic.db.Db@xxx,
  [[[rule1 ?ent] [?ent :community/type ":community.type/twitter"]]
   [[rule1 ?ent] [?ent :community/type ":community.type/facebook_page"]]
   [[rule2 ?d] [?d :district/region ":district.region/sw"]]
   [[rule2 ?d] [?d :district/region ":district.region/s"]]
   [[rule2 ?d] [?d :district/region ":district.region/se"]]]
)
</pre>

By not having to write such complex Datalog queries and rules "by hand", Molecule 
allows you to

- Type less
- Make type safe queries with inferred return types
- Use your domain terms directly as query building blocks
- Model complex queries intuitively (easier to understand and maintain)
- Reduce syntactic noise
- Focus more on your domain and less on queries



## Dependency in your project

Molecule 0.6.3 for Scala 2.11.8 is available at
[Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/org/scalamolecule/molecule_2.11/)
 so that you can add a dependency in your sbt file to `"org.scalamolecule" %% "molecule" % "0.6.3"`.

Since Molecule generates boilerplate code from your definitions it also needs to have the `MoleculeBoilerplate.scala` file 
in your project folder. Please have a look at how the sbt build file
 of the Molecule project itself puts things together and simply copy that to your own project:

2. Setup your sbt build file [as in Molecule](https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule/blob/master/project/build.scala):
    - Add library dependency `"org.scalamolecule" %% "molecule" % "0.6.3"`
    - List directories where you have your [definition file(s)][setup]
3. [Define schema][schema]
4. `sbt compile`
5. Open in your IDE
6. [Setup your database][setup]
7. [Populate your database][populate] with data
8. [Make molecule queries][tutorial]
